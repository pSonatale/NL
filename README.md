There is a code related to the machine learning model that reads text and analyzes emotions that fit that text.

# KoBERT-based Emotion Analysis Model

This project is a fine-tuning of a **emotional classification model that classifies seven emotions based on the KoBERT model for **Real-time Emotion Analysis**, one of the key features of the Sonatale app.

## ‚úÖ Project Overview

- **Objective**: Emotion classification of sentences extracted from fairy tale text and speech using KoBERT
- **Model**: KoBERT (based on HuggingFace) provided by SKT-AI
- **Sorted Appraisal Class**:
- happy (happy)
- Sadness
- Anger (Anger)
- Fear
- Surprise
- Disgust
- Neutral

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology of use

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- KoBERT (transformers Í∏∞Î∞ò)
- HuggingFace Datasets, AIhub datasets
- scikit-learn (Evaluation Indicator)

## üìä Learning Data

- Using Custom Labeled Fairy Tentings Dataset
- 7 emotional classes in total
- **Single classification rather than multiple emotions**
- Text data preprocessing:
- Integrate different emotions into 7 emotions
- Remove unnecessary parts
- Sentence unit emotion mapping
- Class weight is assigned to each class

## üîß How to learn

```bash
python train.py \
--epochs 10 \
--batch_size 32 \
--lr 2e-5 \
